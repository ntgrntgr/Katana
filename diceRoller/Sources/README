During the first stages of development of this diceRoller, I was testing out to see if the 
separating of class definitions in multiple files would work. 
I encountered errors while compiling but, I looked it up and I was not linking the files correctly. 

I was doing " g++ main.cpp -o test" but this was not working. the error was that main.cpp was calling
the methods defined in dice.cpp but dice.cpp was not compiled yet. 

correction to this was to change the command to this instead. I watched it in a youtube video
" g++ main.cpp -o test dice.cpp"
